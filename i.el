;;; Versions:
;;
;;    0.0.1 - This packages is in early beta version
;;

;;; Usage:
;; See i-test.el for usage examples

;;; Todo:
;; (for * joined ** by ***) - populates * (can be a variable or
;; a list of variables with same values from collections **, whre
;; elements of collections are compared by ***
;;
;; (for * distinct ** by ***) - like joined, but only for distinct values,
;; when there are more then two sequences, at least one pair should fail
;; comparison
;;
;; (for * all-distinct ** by ***) - like joined, but only for distinct values
;; like distinct, but all pairs must fail comparison
;;
;; (for * product **) - populates * (variable or a list of)
;; with dot-products of **, e.g. (for (x y) product '(1 2) '(3 4))
;; will produce:
;; x = 1 y = 3
;; x = 1 y = 4
;; x = 2 y = 3
;; x = 2 y = 4
;;
;; (for * combinations ** of ***)
;; consequently sets * to next combination of **
;; optionally limiting the number of places to ***
;;
;; (for * binary ** check ***)
;; - like across, but moves in halves the length. check
;; is the function to apply to successive elements, must return negative
;; integer, zero or positive integer to establish the order.
;;
;; (for * reverse ** by ***)
;; - like across, but moves in reverse order, by is the step size,
;; which equals to one by default.
;;
;; (for * shuffle **)
;; - like across, but choses unique random elements at each iteration.
;;
;; (generate * **)
;; - generates * by calling ** with last value of * bein the argument.
;; if * is a list, then multiple-value-call is used rather then regular call.
;;
;; (initially *) - execute any code before starting the iteration.
;; 
;; (minimize * into **)
;; - return the minimum of *, optionally set ** to the result
;; (maximize * into **)
;; - return the maximum of *, optionally set ** to the result
;; (count * into **)
;; - return the number of times this clause trigers, , optionally
;; set ** to the result
;; (concatenate * into **)
;; - concatenate * (must be lists), optionally set ** to the result
;;
;; (skip **)
;; - don't execute the rest of the body and move to the beginning of the loop.
;; execute ** (if present) before returning to the beginning of the loop.
;; (next *)
;; - perform whatever action the driver is already assigned to this variable
;; (variable must be declared withing generator).
;;
;; (previous * of ** (steps ****)? default ***)
;; - sets * to the previous value of **, and to *** if ** could not have
;; value at that point. if setps is present, then retreat
;; **** steps back to obtain the value of **
;;
;; first-then ...
;;
;; sum, multiply, reduce
;;
;; uniting, accumulating. with predicates
;;
;; (finding * such-that ** (into ***) on-failure ****)
;;
;; Possible usage examples: create a driver for fibonacci and factorial
;; progressions.
